                 Hello! In this app you can earn points using a clicker game! If you don't know what a clicker
                game is, it's basically a game where you have to click on objects and 1 click = 1 point. 
                You can spend it in a massive mall where you can find a  shop of clothes, 
            etc. You can find a library, a movie theatre, an audio library and much more.
